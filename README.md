# GPT-4o Game Emulator

This project uses the GPT-4o model to emulate text-based versions of various games. The AI responds to user inputs to simulate a fully playable text-based version of the game, emulating as close to the original as possible from start to end.

## Features

- Emulate various games in a text-based format
- Detailed descriptions of game states and options
- Interactive and immersive experience

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- pnpm (Package manager)

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jacksonmills/gpt4o-fire-red.git
   cd gpt4o-fire-red
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

### Running the Emulator

1. Start the emulator:

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

## FAQ

### How can I help the AI generate better responses?

If the AI generates too much detail or goes off track, you can guide it by providing specific feedback. Here are some common scenarios and suggestions on how to address them:

#### The AI generates too many details (e.g., too many trees):

You can ask the AI to simplify the scene by specifying that only outlines or fewer details are needed. For example:

- **You**: "You don't need to show that many trees, just do outlines of trees for walls maybe."

#### The AI doesn't provide enough options:

You can prompt the AI to give more actionable options or detailed choices. For example:

- **You**: "Can you provide more options for what I can do next?"

#### The AI gets stuck or repeats itself:

If the AI seems stuck or is repeating the same information, you can redirect it by asking a new question or suggesting a new action. For example:

- **You**: "Move forward and see what is ahead."
- **You**: "Check my inventory."

#### The AI misunderstands your input:

If the AI misunderstands your command, you can rephrase your request or provide more context. For example:

- **You**: "No, I meant to look at the map, not move forward."

### What should I do if the AI's response is not what I expected?

If the AI's response is not what you expected, you can clarify your request or provide additional instructions to guide it. For example:

- **You**: "Thatâ€™s not quite what I was looking for. Can you describe the surroundings in more detail?"
- **You**: "Please focus on the main path and describe any significant landmarks."
